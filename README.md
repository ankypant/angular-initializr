# Angular-initializr

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.6.

This is a Angular starter project, which will reduce the complexity of settings up
a base project everytime.

I have tried to follow all the best practices, from official and other Angular geeks 😉
and I have also customized the default material theme, added angular flex-layout,
navGuards, Http-interceptor, Lazy loading, Shared modules, Core modules, json-server,
proxy-config.json etc.

I have also replaced the default unit testing frameworks `Jasime & Karma` with `Jest` (with some unit testing) to increase the performance.
This starter project also comes with the awesome `Cypress` testing framework (Login example included), which
replaces the default `e2e` framework used in Angular projects.

It also comes with Login and home component (with some code) as an example, so that you get familiar with
this starter project and the way it is been setted up.

I hope you love and enjoy this starter template, and also find it interesting 😎

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Json server

Run `npm run json-server` for a json server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
Don't forget to start the json server before you try to login, as it is required
to get dummy user details.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
or `npm run test:watch` to watch the changes in the unit testing while you code them.
This project will also generate the code coverage which can be seen by hosting/deploying
coverage folder.

## Running Automation

Run `npm run cy:open` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
Running this command should deploy angular project, json-server and also should
open the cypress window.
